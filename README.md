# Student Result Evaluator (C Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Result Evaluator** is a simple C-based program developed as my **1st Semester Mini Project**.  
This project takes marks of individual subjects from the user, validates the input, calculates the **Total marks**, **Percentage**, and assigns a **Grade** based on predefined percentage ranges.

The project demonstrates the practical use of **Basic C Programming Concepts** such as input/output, conditional statements, variables, and arithmetic operations.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was created as part of my **1st Semester Mini Project** to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **C Programming Fundamentals**
- Learn how to take **User input using `scanf()`**
- Apply **Conditional logic using nested if-else**
- Understand real-life applications of programming in **Student Result Processing**
- Practice writing **Structured and Readable Code**

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Takes marks for **Multiple Subjects Individually**
- Validates that marks are between **0 and 100**
- Calculates:
  - Total Marks
  - Percentage
- Assigns grades based on percentage:
  - A, B, C, D, E or F
- Displays the final result clearly on the screen

---

## 🛠️ Utility of the Project
This project can be useful for:
- Beginners learning **C Programming**
- Understanding **Student Grading Systems**
- Academic demonstrations and lab experiments
- Mini projects and viva preparation
- Practicing logic building and validation checks

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project
While developing this project, I learned and improved my understanding of:
- Writing basic **C Programs** using a structured approach
- Taking user input using **`scanf()`**
- Using **Variables and Data Types** effectively
- Applying **Arithmetic Operations** to calculate totals and percentages
- Implementing **Conditional Statements (if-else and nested if-else)**
- Performing **Input Validation** to handle incorrect data
- Displaying formatted output using **`printf()`**
- Understanding how programming can be applied to **Real-World Academic Problems**
- Writing **clean, readable, and well-documented code**
- Creating and maintaining a **GitHub repository** with proper documentation

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
This project can be enhanced further by:
- Using **Arrays** instead of individual variables
- Allowing **Dynamic number of subjects**
- Adding **Pass/Fail status per subject**
- Implementing **File Handling** to store results
- Creating a **Menu-Driven Program**
- Adding **GUI or web-based interface**
- Converting it into a **Student Management System**

# Student Result Evaluator (C Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Result Evaluator** is a simple C-based program developed as a **1st Semester Mini Project**.  
This project takes marks of individual subjects from the user, validates the input, calculates the **total marks**, **percentage**, and assigns a **grade** based on predefined percentage ranges.

The project demonstrates the practical use of **basic C programming concepts** such as input/output, conditional statements, variables, and arithmetic operations.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was created as part of my **1st Semester Mini Project** to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **C programming fundamentals**
- Learn how to take **user input using `scanf()`**
- Apply **conditional logic using nested if-else**
- Understand real-life applications of programming in **student result processing**
- Practice writing **structured and readable code**

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Takes marks for **multiple subjects individually**
- Validates that marks are between **0 and 100**
- Calculates:
  - Total Marks
  - Percentage
- Assigns grades based on percentage:
  - A, B, C, D, or F
- Displays the final result clearly on the screen

---

## 🛠️ Utility of the Project
This project can be useful for:
- Beginners learning **C programming**
- Understanding **student grading systems**
- Academic demonstrations and lab experiments
- Mini projects and viva preparation
- Practicing logic building and validation checks

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project
While developing this project, I learned and improved my understanding of:
- Writing basic **C programs** using a structured approach
- Taking user input using **`scanf()`**
- Using **variables and data types** effectively
- Applying **arithmetic operations** to calculate totals and percentages
- Implementing **conditional statements (if-else and nested if-else)**
- Performing **input validation** to handle incorrect data
- Displaying formatted output using **`printf()`**
- Understanding how programming can be applied to **real-world academic problems**
- Writing **clean, readable, and well-documented code**
- Creating and maintaining a **GitHub repository** with proper documentation

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
This project can be enhanced further by:
- Using **arrays** instead of individual variables
- Allowing **dynamic number of subjects**
- Adding **pass/fail status per subject**
- Implementing **file handling** to store results
- Creating a **menu-driven program**
- Adding **GUI or web-based interface**
- Converting it into a **student management system**
